# 30 Day Map Challenge 2025
The 30 Day Map Challenge is an exciting opportunity to dive into the world of cartography, data visualization, and creative mapping! 

## This year's focus: Open Source and AI

There are so many ways to make maps! Methodologies below.

### Challenge Themes

#### Upcoming Maps

| Day  | Theme     | Description             | Topic |
|------|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1    | 📍 **Points**   | Challenge Classic: Map with point data (e.g., individual locations, points of interest, clusters). Focus on effective symbolization and density visualization.         | [Historic Forts](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day01_points/map.html) |
| 2    | 📏 **Lines**   | Challenge Classic: Map linear features (e.g., roads, rivers, migration paths, flow lines). Explore line thickness, color, and direction to convey information.        | [Fluid Frontiers](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day02_lines/day02.png) |
| 3    | 🔲 **Polygons**   | Challenge Classic: Create a map focused on area features (e.g., administrative regions, land use, boundaries). Use fills, patterns, and choropleth techniques.        | [Washington, DC Building Heights](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day03_polygons/map.html) |
| 4    | 🧰 **My Data**   | Map something personal using your own dataset. Visualize GPS traces, your commute, or a unique, small dataset you created. (Need simple data? Try geojson.io)        | [London Walk](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day04_mydata/index.html) |
| 5    | 🌍 **Earth**   | Classical Elements ¼: Focus on the tangible and grounded. Map landforms, geology, soil, agriculture, elevation, or anything solid beneath your feet.        | Stegosaurus Fossils in the Cretaceous Period: [Globe](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day05_earth/day05_globe.png) [Projected Map](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day05_earth/day05_projection.png) |
| 6    | 📦 **Dimensions**   | Map beyond 2D. Visualize data using 3D models, extrusions (building heights), depth, time (as a dimension), or an unconventional multivariate approach.        | [A Flattened Earth](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day06_dimensions/day06.png) |
| 7    | 🚝 **Accessibility**   | Map how people (or things) get around. Visualize travel time, barriers, inclusive design, public transport reach, or create a map that is itself highly accessible to all users.        | [US Post Office Longevity](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day07_accessibility/map.html) |
| 8    | 🌇 **Urban**   | (World Urbanism Day) Map the built environment: dense street networks, highrises, urban sprawl, city infrastructure, or population density within a metro area.        | [Visualizing Urban Change in Pune, India](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day08_urban/day08.mp4) |
| 9    | 🎨 **Analog**   | Step away from the screen! Create your map using traditional methods (e.g., pen, pencil, paint, collage, physical models). Show the handmade process!        | [Projection on Orange](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day09_analog/day09_all.png) |
| 10    | 🌀 **Air**   | Classical Elements 2/4: Focus on the atmmosphere. Map weather, wind patterns, air traffic, pollution, or airborne transmission (e.g., pollen, sound).        | [Flight of the Rosefinch](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day10_air/index.html) |
| 11    | 🐜 **Minimal Map**   | Challenge yourself to use the fewest possible elements (color, line weight, labels) while keeping the map clear, useful, and informative.        | [Principality of Hutt River](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day11_minimal/day11.png) |
| 12    | 🔮 **Map from 2125**   | How will maps look 100 years from now? Create a speculative map of what might be (or what you hope will be).        | [2025: Terraforming Titan](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day12_2125/index.html) |
| 13    | ⏰️ **10 Minute Map**   | Start the timer! The maximum allowed time to design and produce this map is 10 minutes. Focus on speed, simplicity, and core communication.        | [Border Hopping in 10 Minutes](https://jaanekaraster.github.io/30-day-map-challenge-25/day13_10minutemap/index.html) |
