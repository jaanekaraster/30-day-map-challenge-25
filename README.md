# 30 Day Map Challenge 2025
The 30 Day Map Challenge is an exciting opportunity to dive into the world of cartography, data visualization, and creative mapping! 

## This year's focus: Open Source and AI

There are so many ways to make maps! Methodologies below.

### Challenge Themes

#### Upcoming Maps

| Day  | Theme     | Description             | Topic |
|------|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1    | 📍 **Points**   | Challenge Classic: Map with point data (e.g., individual locations, points of interest, clusters). Focus on effective symbolization and density visualization.         | [Title]() |
| 2    | **Lines**   | Challenge Classic: Map linear features (e.g., roads, rivers, migration paths, flow lines). Explore line thickness, color, and direction to convey information.        | [Title]() |
| 3    | **Polygons**   | Challenge Classic: Create a map focused on area features (e.g., administrative regions, land use, boundaries). Use fills, patterns, and choropleth techniques.        | [Title]() |
| 4    | **My Data**   | Map something personal using your own dataset. Visualize GPS traces, your commute, or a unique, small dataset you created. (Need simple data? Try geojson.io)        | [Title]() |
| 5    | **Earth**   | Classical Elements ¼: Focus on the tangible and grounded. Map landforms, geology, soil, agriculture, elevation, or anything solid beneath your feet.        | [Title]() |
| 6    | **Dimensions**   | Map beyond 2D. Visualize data using 3D models, extrusions (building heights), depth, time (as a dimension), or an unconventional multivariate approach.        | [Title]() |
| 7    | **Accessibility**   | Map how people (or things) get around. Visualize travel time, barriers, inclusive design, public transport reach, or create a map that is itself highly accessible to all users.        | [Title]() |
| 8    | **Urban**   | (World Urbanism Day) Map the built environment: dense street networks, highrises, urban sprawl, city infrastructure, or population density within a metro area.        | [Title]() |
| 9    | **Analog**   | Step away from the screen! Create your map using traditional methods (e.g., pen, pencil, paint, collage, physical models). Show the handmade process!        | [Title]() |
| 10    | **Air**   | Classical Elements 2/4: Focus on the atmosphere. Map weather, wind patterns, air traffic, pollution, or airborne transmission (e.g., pollen, sound).        | [Title]() |
| 11    | **Minimal Map**   | Challenge yourself to use the fewest possible elements (color, line weight, labels) while keeping the map clear, useful, and informative.        | [Title]() |
| 12    | **Map from 2125**   | How will maps look 100 years from now? Create a speculative map of what might be (or what you hope will be).        | [Title]() |
| 13    | **10 Minute Map**   | Start the timer! The maximum allowed time to design and produce this map is 10 minutes. Focus on speed, simplicity, and core communication.        | [Title]() |
| 14    | **OpenStreetMap**   | Use OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as your primary source. Map your favorite feature, contribute back to the project, or style the map in an interesting way.        | [Title]() |
| 15    | **Fire**   | Classical Elements ¾: Focus on energy, light, or transformation. Map heat, wildfires, energy consumption, population density at night, or volcanic activity.        | [Title]() |
| 16    | **Cell**   | Map something composed of small, discrete units or networks. This could be a geographic cell (raster, tessellation), a cellular network, or a biological/social process (e.g., disease spread).        | [Title]() |
| 17    | **A New Tool**   | Challenge Classic: Experimentation is key! Create your map using a software, language, library, or technique you have never used before.        | [Title]() |
| 18    | **Out Of This World**   | Map something non-Earth: a fantasy realm, an exoplanet, the Moon, Mars, deep space, or a purely conceptual place (e.g., a mental map).       | [Title]() |
| 19    | **Projections**   | (GIS Day) Focus entirely on map projections. Choose an unusual or misunderstood projection to highlight a theme, or visualize distortion. (See xkcd.com/977)        | [Title]() |
| 20    | **Water**   | Classical Elements 4/4: Focus on the fluid. Map hydrology, oceans, currents, water accessibility, sea level rise, precipitation, or anything aquatic.        | [Title]() |
| 21    | **Icons**   | Create a map where icons, pictograms, or custom symbols are the main focus. Use them to highlight points of interest or replace traditional cartographic features.        | [Title]() |
| 22    | **Natural Earth**   | Use the Natural Earth dataset as your primary source for a visually stunning small-scale world or continent map.        | [Title]() |
| 23    | **Process**   | Show how you make a map. This could be a tutorial, a step-by-step graphic, a blog post, a video, or a screenshot of your work environment. Combine it with a map from another day!       | [Title]() |
| 24    | **Places And Their Names**   | Focus on toponymy (place names). Experiment with font choices, label placement, typography, multiple languages, or the history and meaning behind a name.        | [Title]() |
| 25    | **Hexagons**   | Challenge Classic: Use hexagonal binning (hexbins) or a hexagonal grid system to visualize your data. Celebrate this beautiful and efficient tessellation!        | [Title]() |
| 26    | **Transport**   | (World Sustainable Transport Day) Map mobility, traffic flow, public transit networks, logistics chains, or advocate for sustainable transport options.        | [Title]() |
| 27    | **Boundaries**   | Map lines of division—political, physical, ecological, or conceptual. Explore the meaning and impact of a dividing line, real or perceived.        | [Title]() |
| 28    | **Black**   | (Black Friday) Interpret the theme of Black. The map can be purely monochromatic, represent absence/darkness (e.g., light pollution), or relate to themes of consumption.        | [Title]() |
| 29    | **Raster**   | Challenge Classic: Map using raster data. Focus on satellite imagery, elevation models (DEMs), land cover, or pixel-based art.        | [Title]() |
| 30    | **Makeover**   | Take a map you made during the month or an older piece and redesign it. Focus on improving the aesthetics, clarity, or data communication.        | [Title]() |
